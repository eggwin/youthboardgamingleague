					If you are interested in becoming a trainer or coordinator for the YBL, here are some frequently asked questions:
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: What travel is involved?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: You will be assigned to one or more regions of operation. These regions normally correspond with school district and/or county lines and may be very large. You will need to have reliable transportation and be able to reach any site in your region at scheduled times.
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: What kind of time commitments do I need to make?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: As a trainer, all of your activities will be scheduled in advance. Most training sessions last five to six hours. Training sessions normally take place on the weekends, but may take place every day of the week in the weeks leading up to the start of the school year. Most training sessions are completed within the first month of the school year. Some sessions are also scheduled before the spring and summer semesters.
					</p>
					<p>
					As a coordinator, you will have a much more active role in the program. In addition to recruiting new schools into the program, you will need to attend all training sessions and be responsible for keeping contact with and performing site visits at each of the schools throughout the year.
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: What skills and experience do I need?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: As a trainer you need to be able to thoroughly and clearly explain game rules, mechanics, and strategy tips. You will also need a great deal of patience as this concept, while being fun games, is foreign to many.
					</p>
					<p>
					In addition to those listed above, it is highly recommended that coordinators have some sales and/or management experience.
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: What games will I need to know?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: You will need a thorough knowledge of the rules, mechanics, strategies, and pieces of all of the games in the YBL library, currently 90+ games. However because game availability is often an issue, the YBL library is often updated. Therefore a trainer and coordinator must be willing to (essentially) constantly learn new games.
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: How much money can I expect to make?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: Trainers will be paid an hourly wage and receive travel reimbursement to school sites.
					</p>
					<p>
					A: Coordinators will receive the same hourly wage and travel reimbursement for training sessions and site visits. Additionally, coordinators will receive a commission based on the number of new and continuing programs in their region(s).
					</p>
					<p>
					Q: How do I get started?
					</p>
					<p>
					A: If you are interested in becoming a YBL trainer or coordinator, email Dr. Greg Thatcher at <a href="mailto:greg@youthboardgamingleague.com">greg@youthboardgamingleague.com</a>.
