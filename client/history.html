					Health-risk behaviors among youth are nothing new. Recent data indicates nearly 65% of college students and 33% of high school students drink alcohol, while 20% and 22%, respectively, smoke marijuana at least monthly. <a href="#references"><span class="superscript">1</span></a>
					</p>
					<p>
					To combat this trend, Dr. Greg Thatcher, an Associate Professor of Public Health at California State University, Fresno, created a weekend alcohol-reduction/prevention program for college students on his campus. He intended this alternative activities program to provide any student the opportunity to engage with peers in a safe, fun way; avoiding the pitfalls of many college activities on the weekends.
					</p>
					<h2>Meeting the Needs of College Students</h2>
					<p>
					Originally titled Finding Responsible and Entertaining Activities on KampuS (FREAKS), the program began as a student club in the spring 2010 semester on Fresno State’s campus with Dr. Thatcher as its faculty advisor and 11 student members. During this time FREAKS offered all students, faculty and staff, and community/family members an opportunity to get together on Friday nights to play games and have fun. 
					</p>
					<p>
					FREAKS served as a new community where risk-taking behaviors were not even considered. In fact, Dr. Thatcher vowed to never mention FREAKS as a prevention program — risk-taking behaviors were never mentioned during the activities. He wanted FREAKS to be nothing more than a community-based program where everyone had fun. Because of Dr. Thatcher’s previous experience with the games used in the program, however, he knew the program would boost critical thinking and communication skills and reduce health risk-taking behaviors without ever mentioning anything about these topics.
					</p>
					<p>
					Within two years, the program had grown in membership to more than 250 students and community members, with nearly 110 people attending every Friday night — one of the largest gaming communities in the country.
					</p>

					During this time, two local high schools were attending the Friday night events. They knew the program provided an ideal opportunity for their students on Friday nights to enjoy an alternative to their regular and (all too often) unhealthy activities. Additionally, FREAKS members would get to attend an event that would connect them to community and university students that could aid their college and graduation decision-making. Unfortunately, due to space requirements, the program was unable to continue on Fresno State’s campus. Administrators from both high schools lamented the loss of the program, as FREAKS had significantly reduced truancy and discipline issues among those that had attended the events regularly. They asked Dr. Thatcher about the possibility of implementing the program at their schools using an after-school format.
					</p>
					<h2>Meeting the Needs of Public School Students</h2>
					<p>
					In 2012, the Substance Abuse Services Division of the Fresno County Department of Behavioral Health awarded FREAKS a grant to fund the games and train volunteers at one local high school. This grant funded a pilot program that commenced in the fall 2012 semester. More than 35 students participated in the program and the school proclaimed it strongly successful — an exciting time for the program. 
					</p>
					<p>
					On July 16, 2013, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, awarded Dr. Thatcher Registration Number 4,367,449, giving FREAKS a formal trademark for education services.
					</p>
					<p>Because of its initial success, the program expanded beginning in the fall of 2013. The program applied for, and received, additional grant funding to establish ten new school sites, including its first middle school in Los Angeles. By the end of its second year of operation, FREAKS expanded to involve more than 600 students. It seemed time to make the program formal.
					</p>
					<h2>Youth Boardgaming League, Inc.</h2>
					<p>
					Under the name Youth Boardgaming League, Inc., Dr. Thatcher received 501(c)(3), non-profit status for the program in February 2015. As of the spring of 2016, the Youth Boardgaming League has directly impacted more than 1,700 students in 40 elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the state of California. In the fall of 2016, the League will expand to Charlottesville, VA, its first out-of-state location. 
					</p>
					<p>The Youth Boardgaming League has been shown to elevate critical thinking and communication skills, reduce health risk-taking behaviors, and alleviate discipline issues. With its low-cost alternative to traditional after-school programs and its ability to reach students who historically shy from after-school programs, Youth Boardgaming League offers tremendous value to public schools, especially those in the Central Valley.
