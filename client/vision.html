					<p>Our mission is to develop well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, critical thinking and leadership skills in youth participants through engagement in safe and fun activities.</p>
					<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>
					<p>To develop a national after-school program utilizing critical thinking and communication-based strategy board games.</p>
					<p><hr></p>
					<p>“Over the past 15 years, board games have changed their focus from luck and simple mechanics to a broad range of life-skill mechanics such as money management, group dynamics, communication and negotiation, and problem solving.</p>
					<p>These games assist participants in understanding universal life themes and how to turn them from abstract concepts into concrete actions. These include [but are not limited to] &#8230; justice, freedom, honor, integrity, respect, fairness, ethics, joy… and greed.”</p>
