					<h2>Who We Are</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Our organization is called Youth Boardgaming League (YBL) and is headquartered in Fresno, CA.</li>
						<li>We are a 501(c)(3) managed by Dr. Greg Thatcher, a full-time faculty member of Fresno State’s Department of Public Health.</li>
						<li>Seven board members hailing from multiple states form the governing body of YBL.</li>
						<li>Our mission is to:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>provide after-school enrichment for those who do not gravitate toward other after-school programs,</li>
							<li>lower the cost for schools to provide after-school activities, and</li>
							<li>help kids connect with their families.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2>What We Do</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>For the past six years, we have provided school-based activities for 1,700, mostly disadvantaged, students centered on boardgaming.</li>
						<li>Our scope extends to families through our Parents’ Night program</li>
						<li>The board games used by YBL are not traditional board games like Monopoly; they require far more strategic decision-making conducive to positive youth development.</li>
						<li>We train teachers to extend the benefits of the games beyond recreation.</li>
						<li>Although our activities span the entire state, we place special emphasis on Central Valley communities because they are local. Currently, 27 schools statewide offer our program; 22 of those schools are in the Central Valley.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>What We Want to Do</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We have had considerable success, but we want to know if S.H. Cowell Foundation can help us:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>expand our scope to rural, impoverished communities in the Central Valley,</li>
							<li>reach more disadvantaged kids such as foster/homeless youth, English learners, and students with disabilities, and</li>
							<li>offer strong family engagement programs to participating schools.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2>Why We Can’t Do This Now</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Many small, rural schools cannot afford even the most cost-effective after-school programming.</li>
						<li>Rural schools require relatively more time and effort to manage; currently, our organization does not have the internal capacity to handle this increased load.</li>
						<li>We do not own enough board games to meet the increased demand and allow students to check them out for home play.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>What We Are Requesting</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We are seeking $136,500 over three years (with $67,000 allotted for Year 1 activities) to:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>significantly lower the costs to small, rural schools wanting to adopt our program and train their personnel to run their programs and</li>
							<li>hire personnel to manage the project and help the schools encourage students and their families to participate.</li>
							<li>Purchase additional board games.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h2>Why This Will Help</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Once funded, S.H. Cowell’s financial support will:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>provide students a safe, enriching place to meet after school,</li>
							<li>boost cognitive and communication skills and reduce health risk-taking behaviors,</li>
							<li>meet the needs of English learners, mentally/physically disabled students, as well as those introverts that tend to shy from other after-school activities,</li>
							<li>provide an ideal vehicle for families to interact with their kids in fun, engaging activities,</li>
							<li>help students develop teamwork/collaboration skills and improve their emotional intelligence,</li>
							<li>help students (especially English Learners) develop verbal language skills.</li>
						</ul>
