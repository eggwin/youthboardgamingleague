					<h2>Your assistance can make a big difference for students today!</h2>
					<p>
					Youth Boardgaming League is a non-profit organization established to develop critical thinking skills in students of all grade levels. <img src="gaming2.jpg" align="right" width="265" class="wraparound">It provides a unique stimulating opportunity for students who do not gravitate toward other after school programs. This program does not use the typical board games you would find at your local stores, instead we use European-designed board games to challenge students and teach 21st century skills. The major expenses for the program include the board games, training provided to each school and tournaments each year. Our goal is to expand our scope to rural, impoverished communities, reach more disadvantaged kids such as foster/homeless youth, English learners and students with disabilities. Your donation can help provide a safe, enriching environment for students to meet after school.
