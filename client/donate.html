					<h2>Your assistance can make a big difference for students today!</h2>
					<p>
					Youth Boardgaming League is a non-profit organization established to develop communication and critical-thinking skills in students of all grade levels.  <img src="gaming2.jpg" align="right" width="265" class="wraparound">It provides a unique stimulating opportunity for students who do not gravitate toward traditional after school programs. This enrichment program does not use the typical board games you would find at your local stores, instead we use creative European designed board games to challenge students and teach much-needed 21st century skills. The major expenses for the program include the board games, training provided to each school and tournaments each year. Our goal is to expand the scope of this exceptional program to rural, impoverished and underserved communities, to reach more disadvantaged youth such as foster/homeless youth, English language learners and students with special needs. Your support can help provide a safe, enriching environment for students to meet after school, grow and thrive in our communities.
