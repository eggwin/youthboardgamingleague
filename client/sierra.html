					<h1 class="entry-title">Youth BoardGaming League</h1>
					<h4 class="credit_posted_modified">July 22, 2015</h4>
					<p>
					The Oakhurst Library has been hosting a seven-week Youth BoardGaming League every Monday since July 20. This event is held 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The league is open to all children fifth through twelfth grades.
					</p>
					<p>
					Imagine the thrill of sitting at the table with your opponents, carefully evaluating all your options, creating a successful plan of action and then celebrating your victory. This is the kind of excitement you can count on from the games in this program.
					</p>
					<p>
					The program utilizes a wide variety of strategy and communications-based board games. They are from a broad class of tabletop games, mostly from Germany, that generally have simple rules, short to medium playing times (20 minutes to 2 hours), direct and indirect player interaction and attractive components.
					</p>
					<p>
					The games emphasize strategy and communication and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends.
					</p>
					<p>
					The initial idea for this league came from Dr. Greg Thatcher, Associate Professor, Department of Public Health, at Fresno State University. His research has found that these games develop critical thinking and communication skills.
					</p>
					<p>
					The league will meet through August 31. The league is free for the participants because the Friends of the Oakhurst Library donated the boardgames that will be used during play. At the end of the league, awards will be given for various achievements.
