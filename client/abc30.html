								<p>Board games can be more than just a fun family pastime. On Saturday, Fresno State hosted the inaugural Central Valley Boardgaming Championships.</p>
								<p>About 75 students from Fresno, Kings and Merced County middle and high schools went head-to-head in nine strategy games. The event was put on by the Youth Boardgaming League &#8212; an after-school program that helps students learn through games.</p>
								<div class="adRectangle-pos-small-inline" data-set="adAppend"></div>
								<p>&#8220;These games are communication and critical thinking-based games that really benefit them in a hidden way. So the students will play games that ultimately teach them life skills, things like money management and group dynamics,&#8221; said Dr. Greg Thatcher, a public health association professor at Fresno State.</p>
								<p>The winner of Saturday&#8217;s championship walked away with a plaque and an invitation to an awards luncheon. All participating schools also received new games for their programs.</p>
